Q: What is Wizardify?A: Wizardify is a bold attempt to objectively find
once and for all a definite answer to the question
lingering in the consciousness of every single person: What is my innate D&D Ð class?Q: So how does it work thenA: First, you upload the image into the designated field,
after which our magical mystical algorithm analyzes
your features and characteristics, and then makes
a highly educated judgement based on the received data.After mere seconds of intuitive inspecting, you
will be given an answer, of how your very being resonates
with the 12 different classes. If you wish to know more
about your adventurous self, we suggest a quick visit to the 
About Ð page (or some other more fleshed Ð out source is also acceptable).Q: Alright, so what am I to do with this information?A: As we all know, people are very complicated, as are
character-classes and alignments.
Thus, if you feel indecisive about what you truly feel like,
we provide a fun and easy way for you to set out your
character-creation for your next big adventure!Q: And what if I disagree with the results?A: Being varying degrees of nerds ourselves, we do feel your
infinite despair of wishing to be a paladin but turning out to be a bard.
However, given that the service we provide is free and possesses
absolutely zero risks for the user, we do not have a money-back guarantee,
for there is no money to give back.
We trust you to make a judgement call about whether you wish
to set out as what our system deems so suit you the best,
or as something you actually want to be.Happy trails!- ArkiLouhinta
